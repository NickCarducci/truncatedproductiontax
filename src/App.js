      <h1>Is it a good idea to use home equity for an investment?</h1>

      <h2>Originally Answered: "Are home equity loans a bad investment?"</h2>
      Foreclosure needs to be deducted when default, extension is surrendered
      freedom of others (EULA, third party donee beneficiary claimable).

      Home equity loans are like shorting if you are the lender, and fungible
      for debt and whatever you can get for the home as the borrower (we haven’t
      had a market crash of tightening then loosening, suspending market-ask
      outstanding share split Fed “purchases,” then continuing them abruptly
      chasing everyone into bonds, and 40% debt spending). Normal collateralized
      loans, the lenders’ profit depends on a positive correlation with
      collateral value if foreclosed, but with a HELOC their profits are capped
      by the principal, as foreclosure deducts from principal the price of the
      foreclosure sale (I would hope). Worst case scenario as a lender for a
      home equity loan is a falling market and then default (ostensibly).

      Home equity loans are like selling an option to sell, functionally
      providing a ‘credit’ to the borrower whom pays it back, like a normal
      (mortgage) loan thereafter, where the purchase would otherwise be made
      from a third party producer, or new product. In comparison to a mortgage,
      the lender has precedence to have the par-timeLeft value backed up by
      courts than collateral, and extension, alone, perhaps because it has
      collateral gains, capped - and a higher rate, compared to a mortgage, on
      average.
